caption = ["An astronaut is riding a horse.",
           "Two wolves were hunting a rabbit in the snow.",
           "Two men were fishing and a woman was standing by.",
           "A completely still tree."]

story = [
    "A sleek white spacesuit clings to the astronaut, each segment glinting faintly under the soft moonlight with a smooth, metallic sheen. "
    "The helmet visor, a dark, glossy curve, reflects the starry expanse, masking the riderâ€™s face. The astronautâ€™s gloved hands grip leather reins, steady but light. "
    "Beneath them, a deep chestnut horse charges forward, its short, velvety coat rippling with every powerful stride. "
    "The horseâ€™s long, black mane streams wildly in the wind, whipping against the astronautâ€™s suit as they gallop across the barren ground. "
    "The horseâ€™s hooves strike the earth with rhythmic force, scattering dry dust into swirling clouds. "
    "Each movement of the astronaut mirrors the animal's fluid motionâ€”leaning forward, rising slightly in the stirrups as the horse surges ahead, "
    "then sinking back into the saddle during brief moments of stillness. "
    "The glinting suit contrasts with the horse's dark coat, their forms moving as one against the vast, quiet night.",

    "In the vast whiteness of the snowy forest, two wolves stalk quietly. "
    "One is large and heavyset, its fur a mix of dark grays and black, blending into the shadows of the trees. "
    "The other is leaner and quicker, with a pale, almost silver coat that glimmers in the winter light. "
    "Their eyes are sharp and focused, and each step is measuredâ€”one wolf pacing powerfully, the other darting with agile precision. "
    "Ahead of them, a small white rabbit crouches in the snow, nearly invisible but for the black tips of its ears and nose. "
    "Suddenly, the rabbit bolts, kicking up a spray of powder. "
    "The dark wolf charges forward with brute force, while the silver one sprints with smooth, loping strides. "
    "The rabbitâ€™s movements are frantic and unpredictable, weaving between tree roots and leaping over snowdrifts. "
    "The wolves flank it from both sides, their breaths clouding the air, closing in like shadows. "
    "At the last moment, the rabbit dives into a narrow burrow, disappearing into safety. "
    "The dark wolf sniffs the ground, frustrated, while the silver wolf paces briefly before the two melt back into the forest, "
    "leaving only their crisscrossing prints behind in the snow.",

    "On the bank of a quiet river, two men sit, fishing rods in hand, lost in their shared pursuit. "
    "One man is tall and lanky, his clothes slightly rumpled and sleeves rolled up as if fishing were an afterthought. "
    "His hair sticks out messily beneath a flat cap, and his exaggerated gestures reveal his impatienceâ€”he tugs too hard at his line, pulling in a clump of weeds. "
    "The other man is shorter and stockier, with neatly combed hair and a vest buttoned tight over his belly, giving him a more proper air. "
    "He watches the first manâ€™s struggles with a smug grin, adjusting his hat to shade his eyes, clearly taking pride in his methodical approach. "
    "Standing nearby is a woman, poised and elegant, her neat dress and parasol making her seem out of place among the two fishermen. "
    "A ribbon in her hair catches the light breeze, and she stands with her arms crossed lightly, the hint of a smile playing on her lips as she observes the menâ€™s playful bickering. "
    "The lanky man throws up his arms in frustration, while the stocky one chuckles under his breath, confident his patience will pay off.",

    "The film opens with a solitary tree standing tall in the middle of a vast field, perfectly motionless. "
    "Its trunk is thick and gnarled, twisting upward into jagged, angular branches that stretch like frozen lightning across the sky. "
    "The sparse leaves, clinging stubbornly to the crooked limbs, hang still, untouched by even the slightest breeze. "
    "As the sun rises, the world around it bustlesâ€”wind sweeps through the grass, animals scurry by, clouds drift overheadâ€”but the tree remains utterly unmoving. "
    "Throughout the day, people pass by: a child throws a rock at the trunk, a farmer rests in its shade, and a couple carves initials into the bark. "
    "Time shifts rapidly, marked by the changing skyâ€”sunlight fades, storms lash the field, snow blankets the branchesâ€”yet the tree stays unyielding, "
    "its jagged silhouette cutting against the changing seasons. "
    "In the final shot, the night settles in, and with only the distant howl of wind, the tree stands in absolute silence, unchanged, as if waiting for something that never comes."
